<h3>Texts - Grey colors</h3>
<p class="text">Reversible greys
The grey colors are reversible. Each light grey color has a complementary dark grey color. This helps keeping the colors well balanced and also makes it easier to implement light/dark themes. Good example of this is the Marvel editor, which is implemented in the dark theme.</p>
