name: Primary & Secondary Action Buttons

<p class="text"><b>Error Prevention</b>: As Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristic says: “Careful design prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.” You should try to eliminate error-prone conditions which might happen when users accidentally select a wrong option.
Visual weight: To make clear distinction between two options, you have to use different visual weight for buttons .
Clear and distinct label: A good dialog box isn't just about asking users which action they want to perform.It's also about making each option as clear as possible. That's why it's so important to have a distinct label for each option. 
An explicit label serves as “just-in-time help,” giving users more confidence in selecting the correct action:</p>
<p class="text">- It’s often better to name a button to explain what it doesthan to use a generic label (like “OK”).</p>
<p class="text">- Use a verb whenever possible instead of ‘Yes’ or ‘OK’ because your buttons will make sense out of context with the explanatory text or title.</p>
